# Question 5 Solution

My additions to the repository consist of the new files include/pqxx/pqxx_json.hpp and src/pqxx_json.cpp, which implement conversions of several types of libpqxx result sets to C++ JSONs. The json data type in C++ has been excellently implemented by a third-party source at https://github.com/nlohmann/json and its interface works almost exactly like JSONs in JavaScript. Hence, I have decided to use this data type for C++ JSONs. This json data type is officially called nlohmann::json, which I can identify as "json" by writing "using json = nlohmann::json". The only file needed from that repository is the json.hpp file, which I have included in the "include" subdirectory in this repository.

Specifically, the functions in include/pqxx/pqxx_json.hpp are all called to_json and are all contained in the pqxx namespace. This is because all the data types that these to_json functions convert to nlohmann::jsons are contained in the pqxx namespace and the nlohmann::json data type contains a constructor that allows an nlohmann::json object to be automatically initialized from a pqxx data type if there is a to_json implementation for said pqxx data type in the same namespace as that data type, which is pqxx. 

To execute these functions while running libpqxx, these functions can be integrated into the libpqxx shared library, which one can learn how to do by reading the instructions in the README.md on the original libpqxx repository (https://github.com/jtv/libpqxx) as well as the instructions in the README.md on the nlohmann/json repository (https://github.com/nlohmann/json).
